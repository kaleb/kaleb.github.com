    title: Mutt E-Mail Client and Gmail Over IMAP
    layout: post

---

I wanted to set up [mutt][] to check my [Gmail][] over [IMAP][].  Mutt is a
highly configurable [TUI][] email client.  Since it is so configurable and I am
already conditioned to using Gmail's keyboard shortcuts, I have decided to
share my `mutt` configuration to emulate Gmail.
