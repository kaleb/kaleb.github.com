I moved my website to my new domain, [horns.by][1].  I do like my new vanity
domain, but it was not the most straightforward or cheapest setup.  For anybody
thinking about getting a [Belarusian domain][2], there are a few things that
should be known.

First, a .by domain is expensive.  It is [listed as $15][3], at least 33% more
than I have paid for any other domain.  This is the price before the 20%, or $3,
[VAT][4], bringing the total up to $18 a year.  This was not the last of the
unexpected fees, however.  The registrar does not take any expected form of
payment.  What they do accept is wire transfer which added additional costs.

The monetary expense was not the only thing making a .by domain a poor value.
The lack of DNS management provided with the domain was unexpected.  To overcome
this, I decided to use [Cloudflare][5] free DNS management.  After getting it
set up, everything has worked great.
